** build

For example, with the Regular variant:

- Open ~src/agave-r.sfd~ in FontForge.
- Click *File* --> *Generate Fonts* --> pick *TrueType*, *No Bitmap Fonts*, *No Rename* --> /Options:/ pick *TrueType Hints*, *PS Glyph Names*, *OpenType* --> *Generate*.
  - You might see (and can ignore, I think) some warnings about non-integral coordinates, etc.
- Hint the generated font file using ttfautohint.
  - Assuming the generated file is ~raw.ttf~, run ~ttfautohint -v -t raw.ttf Agave-Regular.ttf~


** name

- *type agaric* opted for a slightly eponymic name for their first typeface.
- "Agave" refers either to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave][green plant]] or to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agave_(Theban_princess)][daughter of Kadmos]] in mythology.
- *agave* is sister to [[https://github.com/blobject/autonoe][autonoe]] and [[https://github.com/blobject/ino][ino]].
